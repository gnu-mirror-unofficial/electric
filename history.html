The Electric VLSI Design System was originally written in 1982
by Steven M. Rubin at the Fairchild A.I. Laboratory
in Palo Alto, California.

<P>
The first published paper appeared in 1983
[Rubin, Steven M., &quot;An Integrated Aid for Top-Down Electrical Design,&quot;
<I>VLSI '83</I> (Anceau and Aas, eds), North Holland, Amsterdam, 63-72,
August 1983.]

<P>
Since its creation, Electric was made available to universities
in source-code form.
Within five years, it was in use at hundreds of schools around the world.

<P>
For a time in the mid 80s, Electric was released commercially
under the name Bravo3VLSI.

<P>
In 1988, Electric Editor Incorporated (EEI) was founded by Brian
Gardiner and Steven M. Rubin.

<P>
In 1998, Electric Editor Incorporated decided to give the Electric source
code to the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</A>.

<P>
In 2000, Electric was sold to Static Free Software, which
remains committed to free distribution, and offers
development, training, support, and documentation for the system.
