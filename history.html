<p>
The Electric VLSI Design System was originally written in 1982
by Steven M. Rubin at the Fairchild A.I. Laboratory in Palo Alto, California.
</p>

<p>
The first published paper appeared in 1983
[Rubin, Steven M., &quot;An Integrated Aid for Top-Down Electrical Design,&quot;
<i>VLSI '83</i> (Anceau and Aas, eds), North Holland, Amsterdam, 63-72, August 1983.]
</p>

<p>
Since its creation, Electric was made available to universities in source-code form.
Within five years, it was in use at hundreds of schools around the world.
</p>

<p>
For a time in the mid 80s, Electric was released commercially by Applicon under the name "Bravo3VLSI."
</p>

<p>
In 1988, Electric Editor Incorporated was founded and sold the system commercially.
The company released the Electric source code to the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> in 1998.
</p>

<p>
In 2000, Electric Editor Incorporated closed shop and sold Electric to Steven Rubin,
who created Static Free Software, a company that manages the free distribution of Electric.
</p>

<p>
In September, 2003 the "C" version of Electric was abandoned, and a translation was begun to the Java language.
The work was completed in June, 2005. Although the C code is still available, it is no longer developed or supported.
</p>

<p>
In 2004, Static Free Software became a division of RuLabinsky Enterprises, Incorporated.
The new corporation continues its dedication to free software.
