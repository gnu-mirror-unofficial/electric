Electric supports multiple design technologies including:
<UL>

<LI>n-channel MOS (nMOS).</TD></TR>
<LI>Complementary MOS (CMOS), many different versions including
MOSIS rules (6-metal, double-poly), and
Round rules (from Cal Tech).
<LI>Bipolar (Integrated Injector Logic).
<LI>BiCMOS (hybrid of Bioplar and CMOS).
<LI>Digital Filter arcitectural layout.
<LI>Printed Circuits (display only of up to 8-layer boards).
<LI>Schematics (both analog and digital components).
<LI>Artwork (for graphic design).
</UL>
Each technology is a collection of components and connecting wires.
In addition, the technology describes all characteristics of its components
and wires including the graphical descriptions, design rules, simulation aspects, etc.
A technology is a module that can easily be added to Electric to provide a custom design environment.
In addition, a technology editor allows interactive creation and modification.

<CENTER><H1>Analysis and Synthesis Tools</H1></CENTER>
The system stores both connectivity and geometry so that analysis and
synthesis tools can easily acquire the information they need.
For example, the incremental design-rule checker uses connectivity
information to avoid
complaining about situations that other locality-based checkers would
erroneously flag.
These are the tools available in Electric:

<H3>Design-Rule Checking</H3>
The incremental design-rule checker watches all changes made to the layout and displays error messages
when violations are detected.
It checks for spacing errors, notch errors, and minimum size violations.
<P>
A hierarchical design-rule checker does a thorough check of the circuit but takes longer to run.

<H3>Electrical-Rule Checking</H3>
The electrical-rule checker examines all well areas, ensuring proper contacts and spacings.
<P>
It also is able to check for antenna rules violations.

<H3>Simulation</H3>
Electric has a built-in 12-state switch-level simulator, called ALS.
It also supports a built-in version of the IRSIM simulator.
These simulators display waveforms in a separate window and let users cross-probe from either
the waveform or the circuit window.

<H3>Simulation Interface</H3>
Electric is able to produce input decks for a number of popular simulators, including:
<UL>

<LI>Device-level simulators such as Spice.
<LI>Switch-level simulators such as Silos, Tegas, IRSIM, ESIM, RSIM, RNL, Cosmos, and Mossim.
<LI>Behavioral-level simulators such as Verilog.
<LI>Miscellaneous simulators such as PALs.
</UL>
<P>
Users of Electric must obtain these simulators on their own.

<H3>Generation</H3>
The CMOS PLA generator works from a library of PLA elements, thus allowing customized arrays.
<P>
The ROM generator builds a ROM layout from a personality table.
<P>
The Pad Frame generator places pad cells around a chip core and wires them together.

<H3>Compaction</H3>
The compactor adjusts geometry to its minimal spacing in the X and Y axes.

<H3>Logical Effort</H3>
Logical Effort is a system for marking digital schematic gates with fanout
information that will produce optimally fast circuits.

<H3>Routing</H3>
The maze router runs single wires between points.
<P>
The cell stitching router make explicit connections where cells abut or overlap.
<P>
The mimic router watches user activity.
When it sees a wire being created or deleted, it repeats the activity
in similar situations throughout the circuit.
<P>
The river router runs multiple parallel wires in a channel between cells.

<H3>VHDL</H3>

The VHDL system can generate VHDL from a layout, and can compile VHDL to netlists
of various format.
These netlists can then be simulated with the built-in simulator,
turned into layout with the silicon compiler,
or saved to disk for use by external simulators.

<H3>Silicon Compiler</H3>
The Silicon Compiler places and routes standard cells from a structural netlist (which can be
obtained from VHDL which can be obtained from a schematic drawing).

<H3>Network Consistency Checking (LVS)</H3>
The network consistency checker uses the "Gemini" algorithm to
compare a layout with its equivalent schematic.
It can also compare two different versions of a layout or two different versions of a schematic.

<H3>Project Management</H3>
This built-in system allows users to share a library of circuitry.
Users can check out cells for editing and check them back in when done.
Other users are prevented from changing checked-out cells, and can have their
circuits updated when changes are checked in.
<P>
In addition, users are prevented from making changes to checked-out cells that would affect other
cells that are not checked-out.
Also, warnings are issued when multiple users check-out cells that are hierarchically related
which may cause interference in their editing.

<CENTER><H1><A NAME="Interfaces">External Interfaces</A></H1></CENTER>

Electric reads and writes libraries of circuitry in its own format.
However, for maximum compatibility with other EDA systems, Electric
supports a number of
popular interchange and manufacturing formats:
<UL>
<LI>CIF: Caltech Intermediate Format.
<LI>GDS II: the Calma interchange format.
<LI>EDIF: the electronic design interchange format.
<LI>DXF: the AutoCAD mechanical format.
<LI>VHDL and Verilog: hardware description languages.
<LI>EAGLE, PADS, EDAD, and SUE: schematic capture packages
<LI>HPGL and PostScript: plotting languages.
